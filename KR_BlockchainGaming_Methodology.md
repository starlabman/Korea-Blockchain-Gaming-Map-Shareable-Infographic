# Methodology Note: Korean Blockchain Gaming Landscape Research

## Data Collection Sources

Primary sources included official company websites, whitepapers, and press releases from Korean gaming studios. Financial data was sourced from CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap for token valuations, with fundraising information from Crunchbase and public filings. All FDV calculations are based on January 20, 2025 market data.

## Inclusion Criteria & Decisions

Projects were included if they met one of the following criteria: (1) Founded by Korean teams, (2) Primarily operated from Korea, or (3) Global titles with core Korean development teams. This approach captured both pure Korean projects and Korean-led international initiatives. We included both live projects and those in development to provide a comprehensive view of the ecosystem.

## Key Limitations

Financial valuations may fluctuate significantly in volatile crypto markets. Some projects listed as "Live" may have limited user bases or soft launches. Private funding amounts are estimates based on publicly available information and may not reflect actual investment terms. Several projects categorized as "In Development" lack confirmed launch timelines.

Token data is limited to projects with publicly traded tokens, potentially underrepresenting private equity valuations. The analysis focuses on larger, established projects and may not capture emerging indie developers or stealth-mode startups.

## Data Validation

All project information was cross-referenced across multiple sources. Contradictory information was resolved by prioritizing official company sources over third-party reports.
